This Python script uses the OpenCV library to capture video from the default camera (cv2.VideoCapture(0)). The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values of a color are determined using trackbars. 
The script then creates a mask based on these HSV values, which is applied to the original video frame using the cv2.bitwise_and function.
